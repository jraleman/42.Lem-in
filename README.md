## Lem-in

<img src="resources/lemin-finalmark.png" width="350" />

An "Hex" simulator.
lem-in is a program that prints the quickest way to get n ants across the farm.
To be the first to arrive, ants will need to take the shortest path.
They will also need to avoid traffic jams as well as walking all over their
fellow ants.
